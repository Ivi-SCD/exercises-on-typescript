### Exercises:

1. Create a JavaScript calculator that returns a message indicating whether it is more advantageous to fuel with gasoline or alcohol. This calculator should receive from the USER the value of gasoline and then the value of alcohol. Add error handling to prevent the user from providing non-numeric data (with decimal points). In other words, if the user provides an incorrect character, an exception should be created (error handling). Use a function.

2. Write a JavaScript program that prompts the user to enter positive integers. The program should continue prompting for numbers until the user enters a negative number. Then the program should display the sum of all positive numbers entered. Create a function for this.

3. Create a program that reads a start value and an end value, displaying on the screen the count of numbers within that range. Create a function for this.

4. Create a program that receives two numbers (start and end), and displays only the even numbers. Use a function for this.

5. Read the gender of a person (M, F) and print a message informing whether "It's a man" or "It's a woman". If the user does not wish to inform, a third option should be made available.
